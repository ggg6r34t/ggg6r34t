Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Ghyorka and I help manage and oversee ISO27001, lead security awareness training and penetration testing as a cybersecurity specialist. I have strong interest in python programming, social engineering, ethical hacking, and Linux. I am always excited to learn new things and challenge myself.
